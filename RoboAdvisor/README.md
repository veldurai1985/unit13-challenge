# Unit 13 Homework Assignment - The Power of the Cloud and Unsupervised Learning

## Option 1: Robo Advisor for Retirement Plans

### Background

You were hired as a digital transformation consultant by one of the most prominent retirement plan providers in the country; they want to increase their client portfolio, especially by engaging young people. Since machine learning and NLP are disrupting finance to improve customer experience, you decide to create a robo advisor that could be used by customers or potential new customers to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.

In this homework assignment, you will combine your new Amazon Web Services skills with your already mastered Python superpowers, to create a bot that will recommend an investment portfolio for a retirement plan.

You are asked to accomplish the following main tasks:

1. **[Initial Robo Advisor Configuration:](#Initial-Robo-Advisor-Configuration)** Define an Amazon Lex bot with a single intent that establishes a conversation about the requirements to suggest an investment portfolio for retirement.

2. **[Build and Test the Robo Advisor](#Build-and-Test-the-Robo-Advisor):** Make sure that your bot is working and responding accurately along with the conversation with the user, by building and testing it.

3. **[Enhance the Robo Advisor with an Amazon Lambda Function:](#Enhance-the-Robo-Advisor-with-an-Amazon-Lambda-Function)** Create an Amazon Lambda function that validates the user's input and returns the investment portfolio recommendation. This task includes testing the Amazon Lambda function and making the integration with the bot.
